## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd SnapchatClone
npm install expo-av
```

### 2. Database Setup
1. Open your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the entire `VIDEO_SUPPORT_DATABASE_SETUP.sql` script
4. Run the script

### 3. Verify Setup
After running the SQL script, you can verify the setup by running:
```sql
SELECT verify_video_support();
```

### 4. Test the Implementation
1. Start your development server: `npm start`
2. Open the camera screen
3. Try taking photos (tap) and recording videos (hold)
4. Send videos to friends and post video stories

## üéØ Usage Guide

### Recording Videos
1. **Open Camera**: Navigate to camera screen
2. **Start Recording**: **Long press and hold** the capture button
3. **Recording Feedback**: Red button indicates recording, timer shows duration
4. **Stop Recording**: Release the button (automatically stops at 60 seconds)
5. **Share Options**: Choose to send to friends or post as story

### Sending Video Messages
1. Record a video as described above
2. In the share modal, tap on a friend's name
3. Video will be uploaded and sent as an ephemeral message
4. Friend can tap to view, video disappears after viewing

### Posting Video Stories
1. Record a video
2. Tap "üìñ Post Story" in the share modal
3. Video will be uploaded and visible to friends for 24 hours

### Viewing Videos
- **In Chat**: Videos show with native controls, tap to play
- **In Stories**: Videos auto-play when viewing story
- **Story List**: Video stories show with "üé• Video Story" indicator

## üîß Configuration

### Video Settings
- **Maximum Duration**: 60 seconds (configurable in `maxRecordingTime`)
- **Quality**: 720p (balance of quality and file size)
- **File Size Limit**: 100MB (set in database)
- **Supported Formats**: MP4, QuickTime, AVI, MOV, WebM

### Storage Configuration
- **Bucket**: `media` (handles both images and videos)
- **Folder Structure**: 
  - Messages: `messages/{user_id}/{timestamp}.mp4`
  - Stories: `stories/{user_id}/{timestamp}.mp4`

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Video Not Recording
- **Check Permissions**: Ensure camera and microphone permissions are granted
- **Restart App**: Sometimes permissions need app restart
- **Check Storage**: Ensure sufficient device storage

#### Video Not Playing
- **Check URL**: Verify video URL is accessible
- **Network Issues**: Check internet connection
- **File Corruption**: Re-upload if video is corrupted

#### Upload Failures
- **File Size**: Check if video exceeds 100MB limit
- **Network**: Verify stable internet connection
- **Storage Permissions**: Check Supabase storage policies

### Debug Commands
```sql
-- Check video support status
SELECT verify_video_support();

-- View media statistics
SELECT * FROM get_media_stats();

-- Clean up expired media
SELECT cleanup_old_media();

-- View all media content
SELECT * FROM media_content WHERE media_type IN ('video', 'video_story');
```

## üîê Security Features

### Access Control
- **Row Level Security**: Videos only accessible to sender/receiver
- **Storage Policies**: Users can only upload to their own folders
- **Ephemeral Messages**: Videos automatically deleted after viewing
- **Story Expiration**: Video stories expire after 24 hours

### Privacy
- **No Infinite Loops**: Videos configured with `isLooping={false}`
- **Controlled Playback**: Videos don't auto-play in messages
- **User Control**: Users must explicitly tap to view ephemeral videos

## üìä Performance Considerations

### Optimization
- **720p Quality**: Balanced quality/file size ratio
- **ArrayBuffer Upload**: Reliable upload method
- **Signed URLs**: Fallback for public URL issues
- **Database Indexing**: Optimized queries for video content

### Cleanup
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Expired ephemeral messages are cleaned up
- **Storage Management**: Orphaned files can be identified and removed
- **System Logs**: Cleanup activities are logged

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- **Video Compression**: Client-side video compression before upload
- **Thumbnail Generation**: Auto-generate video thumbnails
- **Video Filters**: Add filters and effects to videos
- **Live Streaming**: Real-time video streaming capabilities
- **Video Reactions**: React to videos with emojis

### Configuration Options

- **Quality Settings**: Let users choose video quality
- **Auto-Upload**: Background video processing
- **Batch Operations**: Multiple video uploads

## üìù Notes

### Important Considerations
1. **File Sizes**: Videos can be large, monitor storage usage
2. **Bandwidth**: Consider user data usage for video uploads/downloads
3. **Device Compatibility**: Test on various devices and OS versions
4. **Battery Usage**: Video recording consumes significant battery

### Best Practices
1. **Always test** video functionality on real devices
2. **Monitor storage usage** in Supabase dashboard
3. **Regular cleanup** of expired content
4. **User feedback** for upload/playback issues

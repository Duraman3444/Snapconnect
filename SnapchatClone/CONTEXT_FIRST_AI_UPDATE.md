# ðŸŽ¯ **Context-First AI Enhancement**

## ðŸš€ **What Changed**

The AI suggestion system has been enhanced to prioritize **conversation context** as the primary factor, with mood as a supporting element rather than the main driver.

---

## ðŸ§  **How It Works Now**

### **Priority Order:**
1. **ðŸ“± Conversation Context (80%)**: What's actually being discussed
2. **ðŸ”„ Natural Flow (15%)**: Continuing the conversation naturally
3. **ðŸŽ­ Mood Enhancement (5%)**: Adding user's mood as subtle flavor

### **Before vs After:**
| **Before** | **After** |
|------------|-----------|
| Mood-driven suggestions | Context-driven suggestions |
| Generic responses with mood flavor | Specific responses to conversation content |
| "Friendly: That's awesome!" | "Since you mentioned your exam, how did it go?" |

```

**Scenario 2: Social Plans**
```
Friend: "There's a party this weekend, want to come?"
